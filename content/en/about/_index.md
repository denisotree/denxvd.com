With a background spanning Full Stack Development and Data Engineering, I bring hands-on experience in building scalable data infrastructures and delivering insights that drive decision-making. I started as a Full Stack Developer, creating tailored web applications for media, e-commerce, and design sectors, utilizing JavaScript (TypeScript), Python (Django), and SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL). My journey has since evolved to focus on data engineering, where I manage end-to-end data solutions.  
  
Key Highlights:  
- Data Engineering: As a Senior Data Engineer, I designed and deployed complex data pipelines supporting multiple domains (support, reviews, marketing, user events), unifying them into an integrated data model for seamless analytics. I enhanced ETL workflows with Apache Airflow and managed a distributed data infrastructure using Clickhouse, increasing efficiency and reliability. Through dbt, I established robust data transformation processes, enabling consistent data quality for analysis and ML applications.  
- Analytics & BI Development: In my role as a Senior Data Analyst, I developed a recommendation algorithm that adapts interfaces based on user profiles, elevating user experience across segments. I also implemented an anomaly detection system, reducing response times to product issues. Additionally, I built an internal BI platform for marketing analytics, providing teams with actionable insights and flexible data visualizations.  
  
With a deep technical skill set in Python, SQL, TypeScript, Clickhouse, Apache Airflow, and dbt, I am passionate about creating solutions that leverage data to drive product innovation and optimize business processes. My focus is on developing data-driven strategies that deliver tangible value, building scalable systems that support growth and efficiency.
